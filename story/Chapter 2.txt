Chapter 2

Auriel woke up in the middle of the night and found her room had changed

It now decorated with luxurious furniture

The Door In the middle of the room is glowing blue

Confused and startled, she stood up and tried to open the door. 

It swung open with ease this time.

The Free Standing Door is Connected to a long hallway full of stars

she walk thru the door to see a beautiful scenery 

as she walks thru she see a another door coming in the view

Auriel run to the door and open it

she sees a desk, tables, bookshelfs are full to the brim of books, chairs on every corridor and a big clock on the high wall

she hears a so satisfying yet so mystrious song playing through the whole room

She went to the desk and found a note on the desk and It said:

"Congratulations Auriel, you passed the entrance exam," it read.

"I hope giving this library full of knowledge about the whole world help you."

Auriel was still staring at the note, trying to process the information.

"I passed the entrance exam?" she repeated to herself.

as she wondered what this meant for her

She explore the library and found that every corridor that have a sign infront of it 

with certain number indicating to it and hears the song changing based on where she walking thru

"8?"

She went to a corridor with a sign "8" and went to the shelf to drag a book out

Its a magic book its named "Saint"

She open and read a page of a book 

"[Thunder]: A Class Legendary 8 Spell That Can Strike A Lightning On The Target Point"

it reads

"hmm what? is this a spell? Let's try this. [Thunder]"

She Tried To Cast It But It Did Not Work

Suddenly A Piece of paper dropped from the ceiling

"wheres that paper come from?"

looks up and grab the paper

She open the paper and read the text written to it

"To Cast Library Kind Spell You Can Think Of The Rarity, Book, Class, Type, Name Of The Spell and Level Of The Spell"

"what.... okay then" she said

She Tried To Cast The Spell Again

"[Legendary: Saint: Light: Lightning: 6]"

Suddenly a lightning strike to the room destroying the corridor and causing a fire 

She run out of the corridor and look back on what she done

to her surprise everything is back to normal with a another paper placed on one of the tables

"Using a magic in the library can be dangerous so I made a testing room near the door you went in."

"Also you can't damage anything in the library so don't worry about what you did"

"When Casting A Spell The Chanting Does Not Matter it's about how you define that spell you want"

"good grief I thought I destroy the library" Auriel

She felt relieved after not getting a scolding paper

"every book here is interesting....time to read every book... " she said

As the time passes by she read a book after book but then a ring of a bell can be heard 

She panicked and look at the time

It's 7 o'Clock

"Good Grief I'm Gonna Be Late"

Auriel Ready All Her Things And Went Running Thru The Forrest

On The Way She Test The Spell She Learned From The Library 

She Fire a [Fireball: 3] Spell On A Slime 

"Oh wow it got oblibrated"

Then She Tried Another Spell [Speed: 2] Which To Her Surprise Make Her Go Faster

But In Exchange She Would Feel Light Headed Overtime

she take a break before continuting

while taking a break she hears a mysterious sound similar to the sounds in the library and a light flashed between the trees
