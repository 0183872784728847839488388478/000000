    narrator "Unicity year 65AW"
    pov "Hard to believe this used to be a nuclear wasteland just a few decades ago. I mean... maybe not that hard. It's still shit."
    pov "After the war that ended civilization as we knew it, most survivors banded together to rebuild, and rebuild they did."
    pov "I read in history books that cities used to belong to nations and countries. Well, for better or worse it's not like that anymore."
    pov "Most of Unicity is owned by the Big 8, a select group of the biggest megacorporations. Hell, I'm relatively sure they own most people in it too."
    pov "What the nuclear war didn't finish, consumerism eroded and grasped even further. In a short few decades, most people were deeply in debt to one or more of the corporations. Soon they owned nearly everything."
    pov "The so-called independent enclaves aren't much better. Or so I'm told, not like I can just walk there and check."
    scene intro2 with dissolve
    pov "Most people stay inside the majority of the time. It's safe to go out for a bit, or so they say in the news, but pretty much nobody does."
    pov "Some latent radiation in the ground or some shit... I mean why risk it? You have all you need inside. Everything you can afford you get delivered."
    pov "Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to step outside and explore the remnants of the old world. But fear always holds me back. It's safer to stay here."
    pov "And everything you can't afford... well the Big 8 will happily give you that anyway and charge interest on your debt."
    pov "Debt has become the invisible chains that bind everyone. The Big 8 own everything... But I refuse to be just another pawn in their game. I'll save up and buy Her on my own terms."
    scene intro3 with dissolve
    pov "Schmucks like me can't afford to live in The Towers. Anyone who's anyone lives there. Executives, actors, singers... but to live there you have to pay a fortune. So we sit on top of each other in tiny holes we call homes."
    pov "But I'll get there one day. Once I have Her, everything will turn for the better, I just know it."
    pov "Cooking, cleaning, shopping and... well... other stuff... all that off my head. I'll be finally able to meet that 18-hour work day quota."
    pov "They will surely promote me then."
    pov "Just a few more years of saving..."
    pov "Every day feels like a monotonous cycle of work, sleep, and work again. She is the only glimmer of hope that keeps me going. Maybe with Her help, I can finally reclaim some semblance of a life."
    scene intro4 with dissolve
    pov "When SynteX first introduced AI Maids people thought it was a gimmick. I mean, gen 1 and 2 just..."
    pov "Gen 1's were barely a step above autonomous hoovers that some people had. Gen 2's? Well they decided to make them more humanoid but it was still far off."
    pov "No offence but they look like microwaves with legs and steel tits."
    pov "Gen 3's is when people really started paying attention. With advancements in biotech and artificial intelligence, for the first time they actually felt somewhat... real. They could even operate outside of your home for a limited time. But Gen 4's..."

    pov "With whatever power they had left, government implemented some oversights. By law, semi-sentient AI needs to be distinct from humans, so SynteX chose to give Gen 4s grey skin. All prototypes that didn't meet this condition were 'disposed of'."
    pov "I don't really mind, I think they look perfect... It's a bit unusual but it has a certain charm."

    pov "Huh? Yeah, I'm signed up, but I'm planning my purchase for 68?"
    csagent "Yes, I can see that in the system you have signed up in line to pay for a unit in 68 although I must warn you that you might need to wait even longer for delivery."
    pov "Longer? Like a few weeks?"
    csagent "Our current estimates are that in 68AW the time from purchase to delivery will be around 2 years."

    pov "Sure, I have a minute..."
    csagent "Well, as a valued customer, we have two options available for you right now. Firstly, you can continue holding your queue spot and make the purchase in 3 years plus 2 years estimated delivery for your brand new M41D."
    csagent "Alternatively, we have a recently returned refurbished unit that has been fully restored to factory standard and is immediately available."
    pov "I didn't know you have refurbished units... (And who returns a gen 4?!)"
    csagent "Yes, occasionally some clients decide to return their units after a while, though it doesn't happen often. Our refurbished units undergo a rigorous restoration process, bringing them back to factory standards."
    csagent "They are thoroughly inspected, repaired, and cleaned to ensure optimal performance. While it may not be brand new, it offers a reliable and cost-effective alternative!"
    pov "(Her fake enthusiasm is giving me the creeps) And what's the catch?"
    csagent "Well, the refurbished unit is priced at a discounted rate compared to the original price of a new M41D. It offers a cost-effective option for customers who are looking for a reliable AI Maid without the premium charges or extended waiting times..."
    narrator "...They're sleek, sophisticated, and incredibly lifelike. Having one in your life would make you feel less alone. Even if it's just an illusion."
    pov "...but?"
    csagent "... But you have to make the purchase like... now."
    narrator "The silence hangs heavy, broken only by the soft hum of the malfunctioning air conditioner and the faint flicker of the solitary overhead light. You feel like screaming in anger. You could. Nobody would hear you."
    narrator "These walls were built to support some 50 more stories above you, not to mention a hundred or so below."
    pov "(Well fuck.) Can I call you back in lik..."
    csagent "No, as I'm sure you're aware there is quite the queue so if you don't want her then I will call someone else."
    pov "Five years for a new one huh...? Fuck... And what's the discounted price?"
    csagent "80%% of the retail"
    pov "I don't have that kind of money yet."
